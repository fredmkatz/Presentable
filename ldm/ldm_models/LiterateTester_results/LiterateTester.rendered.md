### Editions

_ **Edition** - a manifestation of a literary work

_basedOn_: LiteraryWork, OtherBase
- ***title*** - the title, as shown on the book's title page (optional reference
FullTitle)

- ***author*** - the writer (optional reference Person)

- ***illustrators*** - artists who supplied the pictures (optional List of
reference People)

__ _Optional Publication Details_ (Optional)

- ***datePublished*** - when the edition was released to the public (optional

%% columns auto (default)
l m n o p q r
end

## Next steps

### Clean up

* Name parsing

+ * value types

+ * Rendering code blocks. capture language

+ * Subtypings - exclusive, exhaustive

+ * Data types with reference/value and cardinality

+ * Optional on Attribute Section


### Complete

* Code types

+ * And data block


### Validation

* cycles

+ * references to classes, subtypings

+ * references to attributes


### Flesh out

* Subtypes, subtypings

+ * inverse attributes

+ * Overrides what

+ * explicit for data type value/reference


### Futures

* Diagrams


## Tests to include

### Headers

Notice that, here, asterisks are used for lists and embedded list, so the items
won't be confused with attributes


* Subject - w/ one-liner

+ * Class one-liner?, Value Type

+ * Attribute Section - optional?

+ * Attribute Header

+ **  with and without one-liners

+ ** with and without data type expressions

+ * Formulas, derivation, default, constraint

+ * Annotations


### Name tests Variations Styling Anchors

In:
### Class clauses

* Plural

+ * Abbreviation

+ * Subtype of

+ * Based on

+ * Where

+ * Diagnostics

+ * Annotations


Fleshed in

+ * Subtypes, subtypings

+ * Dependents

+ * Ancestors

+ *


### Attribute clauses

* Data type

+ * Default

+ * Derivation

+ * Constraint

+ * Required/optional - if/unless


Fleshed in

+ * overrides

+ * inverse of


### Constraints and derivations

## More Tests needed

### Formula Tester English OCL Message Severity

### Data types

* Base Type. Reference vs Value

+ * List, set, mapping types

+ * Nested operators


_ **LiteraryWork**

- ***firstEdition*** - a home for the data type clauses (optional List of
reference Edition)

_ **Edition** - to try more complex data types

- ***author*** - assuming just one

- ***artists*** - allowing for multiple

- ***contributors***

con note: constraints take annotations which may span
def ote: defaults take annotations
der note: derivations take annotations
### Data type clauses

* Optionality
